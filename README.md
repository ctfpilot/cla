# CLA

When contributing to CTF Pilot repositories, you are required to sign a CLA.  
This is done when creating a Pull Request and only needs to be done once.

The CLA gives CTF Pilot the permission to use your contribution under its license(s).

As of the current version (2025-10-25), we are using indieopensource.com Tiny Contributor License Agreement 1.0.0, also known as v1, for this CLA agreement. This can be found in [CLA.md](CLA.md) ([Canonical URL](https://github.com/ctfpilot/cla/blob/1a3a56410df569e0672aafd508044da85f194e8b/CLA.md)).  
If the CLA is changed, you will need to sign the new CLA.

When signing the CLA, your signature will be stored in a directory matching the repository name and CLA version.  
You will need to sign a CLA for each repository.

CTF Pilot is owned and maintained by **[The0Mikkel](https://github.com/The0mikkel)**.
